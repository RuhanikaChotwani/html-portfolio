<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As a second-year B.Tech student specializing in Computer Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, 
   I am actively immersing myself in both foundational and emerging technologies. My academic journey has led me to explore
   web development, where I’m building hands-on experience in HTML,C programming, and Python. These languages have become the core 
   of my learning process, shaping my ability to solve problems methodically and work on real-world projects. Each new skill fuels
    my curiosity, and I am committed to using this knowledge to create innovative solutions that align with future industry needs.
</p>

<p>Beyond the technical realm, this year has been a turning point in my personal development. One of the most impactful skills 
  I've worked on isn’t just related to coding—it’s stress management. Learning to handle pressure has helped me become more 
  emotionally resilient and self-aware, especially when juggling studies, personal goals, and new responsibilities. While I’m not 
  perfect at it, I’m definitely getting better. The process has taught me that inner strength and balance are just as important as 
  technical proficiency, and that progress often stems from persistence rather than perfection.
</p>

<p>More importantly, I’ve begun stepping outside my comfort zone—a shift that has noticeably transformed my attitude and outlook.
   Whether it's initiating conversations with mentors, volunteering for new opportunities, or simply tackling unfamiliar coding 
   challenges, I now approach growth with greater confidence. My ambition is to become a successful computer science engineer and 
   make my parents proud of the journey I’ve chosen. Each small step forward is a promise to myself and to them: that I will keep 
   evolving, not just academically, but as someone who builds with purpose and lives with integrity.</p>
